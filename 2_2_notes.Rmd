***Technical notes***

Time varying graphs show coefficients from linear regressions of outcomes on variables of interest with separate models for each day. Robust standard errors and confidence intervals are calculated using `lm_robust`.  Headings report the `N` for the final day examined plus the partial adjusted $R^2$ for the variable in question. Larger countries dropped because of missing data in controls: `r paste(dropped_countries[-1], collapse = ", ")`.
