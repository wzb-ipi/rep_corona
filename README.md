political, social, and economic correlates of spread

Existing social science research has implications for the kinds of features of  societies that might help explain variation in a society's ability to respond to adverse shocks. In some accounts, for example, more democratic societies will be more responsive; in other accounts, state capacity or social cohesion are more important. We gather together major measures suggested by these literatures and report on the evolving covariance between these measures and the cross national distribution of reported Covid-19 burdens.
