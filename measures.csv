""The corruption index includes measures of six distinct types of corruption that cover both different areas and levels of the polity realm, distinguishing between executive, legislative and judicial corruption. Within the executive realm, the measures also distinguish between corruption mostly pertaining to bribery and corruption due to embezzlement. Finally, they differentiate between corruption in the highest echelons of the executive at the level of the rulers/cabinet on the one hand, and in the public sector at large on the other. The measures thus tap into several distinguished types of corruption: both ""petty"" and ""grand""; both bribery and theft; both corruption aimed and influencing law making and that affecting implementation."" The raw indicators that comprise the components and sub-components of the index are arrived at via expert assessments, aggregated through a Bayesian IRT measurement model (Pemstein et al. 2020).
