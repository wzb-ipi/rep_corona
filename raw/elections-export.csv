"This page provides links to the details of the results of the latest parliamentary election in every country.

The “Last election” column displays the dates of the most recent general/regular elections for directly/indirectly elected parliaments/chambers; and the most recent renewal dates for parliaments/chambers using other modes of designation. The dates of elections are not displayed for a few upper chambers that sit continuously, or for parliaments where the dates cannot be immediately known for various reasons.

The “Expected date of next elections” column indicates the date when the next elections/renewal should normally take place, based on law or practice. Unless relevant laws set a specific election day, dates are calculated based on the dates of the most recent elections/renewal and the term of the chamber or the timing of the partial renewal.
